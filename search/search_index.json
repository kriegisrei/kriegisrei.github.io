Skullgirls Mobile is a gacha game spinoff of \"Skullgirls : Second Encore\" released for the PS3/PS4, Xbox, Switch, and PC. In all reality, you shouldn't be playing this game seriously. If you have never played Second Encore, give it a try! How to win with Squigly Bio-Exorcist Squigly is a very strong character. With a special ability that drains the opponent's health while you're near them, the ability to revive, and regenerate health, Bio-Exorcist can absolutely demolish teams that are higher level than you. (And do it solo!) Battle Opera: Combo Finisher, bounces airborne opponents to the corner so it can be used to corner carry a bit. Stun-Locks opponents on the ground. You can charge while its active but its not true. Drag 'N' Bite: It says damage is low but it actually does quite a lot, use this to corner carry. Use Drag N Bite first, then use Silver Chord. Do not use this move if you don't have any charge left, or if you have one charge left use silver chord because it will not let you combo. The Silver Chord: If you have charge left, wait a second before attacking as it will let you drain more of the opponent's health. Can combo even if you don't have charge. Rage Of The Dragon: Unblockable super. Does a fair bit of damage. Stronger with charge. Opponent quickrises after you use it, so time to charge is small/not an option. Daisy Pusher: Unblockable super, allows you time to charge. Use daisy pusher immedietly after you end a combo, you will always have this built up because of Squigly's ungodly ability to build blockbuster super fast. You can use this move while the opponent is still getting up so you can safely land it without being hit. Explaining Squigly's Mechanics Squigly is a \"charge\" character. When you unlock her special ability, she gets the ability to charge up Leviathan twice. Some moves and supers become stronger and use up one charge, but not all of them (Battle Opera for example). When Squigly has charge, her auto-combos become longer, which is perfect for building a ton of meter and insuring that you will have a blockbuster or two ready every time you are done with a combo. Bio-Exorcist Bio-Exorcist allows Squigly to capitalize off of her charge more than she already can. For starters, if she has charge, she will survive a fatal blow by using her teammates health. More health per charge. If she has no charge, or her teammates are dead, she will not revive. Additionally, Squigly leaches life off of her opponent whenever they are close to eachother. This means that the opponent's health gets drained (Unscaled!) while in combo. Go ahead and try standing next to a training dummy, see how fast their health bar goes down. Squigly can only drain health when she has atleast one charge.
