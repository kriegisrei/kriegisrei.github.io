  <h1>Jindosh Riddle solver for Dishonored 2</h1>
  <p> Instructions for usage: using the image posted, input the people and heirlooms in the order that they appear in YOUR game. Then the script will input the person's name + the heirloom they own. </p>
  <p> Originally going to be a JS project (hence the reason this page exists) but I figured it would be easier to make a short python script. Now this page is used for usage of the script! How far we come. Now time to make a version that requires no user input. Wouldn't that be nice?</p>
